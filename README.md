# Simple Neural Network in C++

This project implements a basic feedforward neural network with one hidden layer in C++. The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm with stochastic gradient descent. The primary goal is to provide a straightforward example of how neural networks can be built from scratch without relying on external libraries.

## Features

- **Feedforward Neural Network**: The network has one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.
- **Sigmoid Activation Function**: Both the hidden and output layers use the sigmoid activation function.
- **Backpropagation**: The network is trained using backpropagation to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Weights and biases are updated using stochastic gradient descent.
